# Fees & Distribution

## Transaction Fee Breakdown

Every PST trade incurs a **10% transaction fee**, automatically distributed as follows:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Treasury Operations** | 8% | PENGU buybacks, resale operations, holder rewards |
| **Operations Share** | 1.5% | Protocol development, maintenance, infrastructure |
| **$INVEST Ecosystem** | 0.5% | Supporting the broader $INVEST ecosystem |

## Treasury Fund Management

The **8% treasury allocation** is automatically split by smart contracts:

### PENGU Allocation Split

| Purpose | Percentage of Treasury | Description |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| **PENGU Trading Operations** | 70% (5.6% of total fees) | Used to buy PENGU and execute resale with markup |
| **Weekly Dividends** | 30% (2.4% of total fees) | Distributed to PST holders every epoch |

## Fee Collection Process

### Automatic Collection
- Fees are collected **automatically** with every PST transaction
- No manual intervention required
- All collections are **on-chain and verifiable**

### Smart Contract Distribution
1. **Transaction occurs** → 10% fee deducted automatically
2. **Treasury receives 8%** → Split into trading (70%) and dividends (30%)
3. **Operations receive 1.5%** → Used for protocol maintenance
4. **$INVEST receives 0.5%** → Supports ecosystem partners

## Treasury Operations Flow

### PENGU Purchase Cycle
1. **Fee accumulation** in treasury trading pool
2. **Threshold reached** → Automatic PENGU purchase initiated
3. **PENGU acquired** at current market price
4. **Split applied**: 70% for resale operations, 30% to dividend pool
