# Dividends

## Weekly Dividend System

- Every week, **30% of PENGU purchased by the protocol** is allocated as dividends for PST holders.
- Distribution is based on a 7-day epoch system, designed to reward longer and more consistent holding.

---

## How Epochs Work

- **Epoch = 7 days**
- Each day, a snapshot of all PST holders is taken.
- On Sunday (the 7th day), a final snapshot is created. **You must be present in the final snapshot to receive dividends for the week.**

## Multiplier Mechanism

- The more daily snapshots you appear in (by holding PST), the greater your rewards:
    - Hit every snapshot of the week (all 7 days)? **7x rewards**
    - Only get in on the last day? **1x reward**
    - Each day of consecutive holding stacks your multiplier. For example, 4 days = 4x, 6 days = 6x, etc.
- **Example**: Hold 1% of supply and appear in all 7 snapshots — you receive 7 times more rewards than someone who holds only for the last day.

## Claiming Rewards

- At the end of each epoch (weekly), dividends are allocated based on snapshot data and multipliers.
- Rewards can be **claimed via the official website** during the claim window (announced with each new epoch).
- Once claimed, rewards are removed from the pending pool; unclaimed rewards after the window may be returned to the next epoch’s distribution.

## Epoch Lifecycle

1. **Start**: Epoch begins, snapshots taken daily.
2. **End**: Final snapshot on Sunday — dividend pool locked for that epoch.
3. **Claim**: PST holders from the final snapshot can now claim their rewards, multiplied by their days of holding during the epoch.
4. **Next Epoch**: New 7-day period begins, system repeats.

## Key Points

- **Longer holding = bigger share** (rewards strongly favor consistent holders)
- You must hold during the final snapshot to be eligible
- Claim your rewards each week via the site
- System is 100% on-chain, verifiable, and automated
