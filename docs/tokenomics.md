## Transaction Breakdown

Every trade of **PENGU Strategy (PST)** triggers a **10% transaction fee**.  
This mechanism funds all on-chain operations — from buybacks to rewards.

| Allocation | Percentage | Description |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Team & Development** | **1.5%** | Supports protocol development, upgrades, and infrastructure costs. |
| **$INVEST Buybacks** | **0.5%** | Dedicated to supporting the $INVEST community through token buybacks, strengthening the broader ecosystem. |
| **Treasury** | **8%** | Main operational pool used for $PENGU buybacks, resales, and reward distribution. |

## Treasury Composition

The Treasury (8%) is divided into two sub-pools:

| Pool | Allocation | Function |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Buyback Pool** | **5.6%** | Executes $PENGU buybacks and resale with 1.2× markup. |
| **Rewards Pool** | **2.4%** | Pays out weekly holder rewards in $PENGU. |

> **Example:** With a $1M market cap, holding 1% of the supply, and $1M weekly trading volume, you'd earn ~$300 weekly rewards, translating to ~338% APY when compounded weekly.

## Economic Cycle

1. **Trading** generates 10% fee → Treasury accumulates.  
2. **Buyback Pool** uses 7% to purchase $PENGU from the Abstract DEX.  
3. **Resale with 20% markup** generates profit.  
4. **Proceeds** are used to **buy back and burn PST tokens**.  
5. **Rewards Pool** distributes 1% in $PENGU to loyal holders.  
6. The cycle restarts — **continuous, deflationary, and automated.**

## Flywheel Summary

> **Trade → Fee → Treasury → $PENGU Buyback → Resale → PST Burn → Rewards → Repeat**

This model ensures that:
- $PENGU demand constantly increases,  
- PST supply continuously decreases,  
- and holders receive periodic rewards — creating a **positive feedback loop** aligned with ecosystem growth.
