## Supply Distribution

**100% Fair Launch - No Pre-allocation**

## Deflationary Supply

- No minting. Supply only decreases.
- 100% of all PENGU sale proceeds buy back and burn PST.
- Burned tokens are permanently destroyed (sent to dead address).
- Each buyback makes PST scarcer.

All tokens were made available to the public from day one through decentralized liquidity pools.

## Fair Launch Mechanics

### Dynamic Fee Launch System

PENGU Strategy launched with a unique anti-bot mechanism:

- **Starting Fee:** 95% on all transactions
- **Fee Reduction:** Decreased by 1% every minute
- **Final Fee:** 10% (current operational fee)
- **Launch Duration:** 85 minutes to reach final fee structure

This approach ensured:
- Protection against MEV bots and snipers
- Fair price discovery for all participants
- Gradual transition to sustainable fee structure
