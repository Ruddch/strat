# 🐧 PENGU Strategy

---

## 🔷 Overview

**PENGU Strategy** is a decentralized token project built on the **Abstract** blockchain.  
It merges automated trading logic, deflationary supply mechanisms, and weekly reward cycles into a single on-chain system centered around **$PENGU**.

Inspired by PunkStrategy, PENGU Strategy replaces NFT flipping with **$PENGU buyback and resale**, creating a fully autonomous flywheel economy where trading activity powers token growth, rewards, and burns.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

### 💰 Transaction Fee Structure

Each **PENGU Strategy** token trade incurs a **10% transaction fee**, distributed between the team and the protocol treasury:

| Allocation | Percentage | Description |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Team & Development** | **2%** | Used for protocol maintenance, development, and ecosystem operations. |
| **Treasury Pool** | **8%** | Core vault used for $PENGU buybacks, resales, and holder rewards. |

---

### 🏦 Treasury Operations

Funds accumulated in the **Treasury (8%)** are automatically managed through smart contracts:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **7%** | Dedicated to **$PENGU buybacks** on the Abstract DEX. |
| **1%** | Reserved for **weekly holder rewards**. |

## 🔁 $PENGU Buyback & Sale Cycle

1. **Accumulation** — Treasury collects fees from trades.  
2. **Buyback** — Once the buy threshold is reached, the protocol executes a **$PENGU buyback** at market price.  
3. **Resale with Markup** — Purchased $PENGU is automatically listed with a **×1.2 markup (20% premium)**.  
4. **Buyback & Burn** — After resale, proceeds are used to **buy back and burn PENGU Strategy tokens**, reducing total supply.

> 🔥 Each cycle creates upward pressure on $PENGU while deflating the PENGU Strategy supply — an on-chain equilibrium of growth and scarcity.

## 🎁 Holder Rewards

Every **epoch (7 days)**, rewards are distributed from the **1% Treasury pool** in **$PENGU**, according to:

- **Holding duration:** the longer you hold, the higher your multiplier.  
- **Holding amount:** larger holders receive proportionally greater rewards.

Rewards are **claimable directly from the smart contract** at the end of each epoch.

---

## 🔒 Transparency & Automation

- All mechanics — buybacks, sales, burns, and rewards — are **fully on-chain and verifiable**.  
- Contracts are **audited and public** on [Abscan](https://abscan.org).  
- No centralized triggers: the system is **algorithmic and autonomous**.

---

## 🧱 Summary

**PENGU Strategy** represents an evolved form of tokenomics — one where trading volume directly drives liquidity, deflation, and community participation.

> **Every transaction strengthens $PENGU, rewards holders, and reduces supply — a true on-chain strategy loop.**
