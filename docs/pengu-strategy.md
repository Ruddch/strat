## Overview

**PENGU Strategy** is a decentralized token project built on the **Abstract** blockchain.  
It merges automated trading logic, deflationary supply mechanisms, and weekly reward cycles into a single on-chain system centered around **$PENGU**.

Inspired by PunkStrategy, PENGU Strategy replaces NFT flipping with **$PENGU buyback and resale**, creating a fully autonomous flywheel economy where trading activity powers token growth, rewards, and burns.

## Core Mechanics

### Transaction Fee Structure

Each **PENGU Strategy** token trade incurs a **10% transaction fee**, distributed between the team and the protocol treasury:

| Allocation | Percentage | Description |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Team & Development** | **1.5%** | Used for protocol maintenance, development, and ecosystem operations. |
| **$INVEST Buybacks** | **0.5%** | Dedicated to supporting the $INVEST community through token buybacks, strengthening the broader ecosystem. |
| **Treasury Pool** | **8%** | Core vault used for $PENGU buybacks, resales, and holder rewards. |

---

### Treasury Operations

Funds accumulated in the **Treasury (8%)** are automatically managed through smart contracts:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **7%** | Dedicated to **$PENGU buybacks** on the Abstract DEX. |
| **1%** | Reserved for **weekly holder rewards**. |

---

## Anti-Whale Protection

To ensure fair distribution and prevent market manipulation, **PENGU Strategy** implements comprehensive anti-whale mechanisms:

| Limit Type | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Max Transaction** | **1%** | Maximum tokens that can be transferred in a single transaction. |
| **Max Wallet** | **3%** | Maximum tokens any single wallet can hold. |

These limits apply to all market transactions and can be adjusted by the protocol owner if needed. Certain addresses (team wallets, contracts) are exempt from these limits to ensure smooth protocol operations.

## $PENGU Buyback & Sale Cycle

1. **Accumulation** — Treasury collects fees from trades.  
2. **Buyback** — Once the buy threshold is reached, the protocol executes a **$PENGU buyback** at market price.  
3. **Resale with Markup** — Purchased $PENGU is automatically listed with a **×1.2 markup (20% premium)**.  
4. **Buyback & Burn** — After resale, proceeds are used to **buy back and burn PENGU Strategy tokens**, reducing total supply.

> 🔥 Each cycle creates upward pressure on $PENGU while deflating the PENGU Strategy supply — an on-chain equilibrium of growth and scarcity.

---

## Holder Rewards

Every **epoch (7 days)**, rewards are distributed from the **1% Treasury pool** in **$PENGU**, according to:

- **Holding duration:** the longer you hold, the higher your multiplier.  
- **Holding amount:** larger holders receive proportionally greater rewards.

Rewards are **claimable directly from the smart contract** at the end of each epoch.

---

## Transparency & Automation

- All mechanics — buybacks, sales, burns, and rewards — are **fully on-chain and verifiable**.  
- Contracts are **audited and public** on [Abscan](https://abscan.org).

## Summary

**PENGU Strategy** represents an evolved form of tokenomics — one where trading volume directly drives liquidity, deflation, and community participation.

> **Every transaction strengthens $PENGU, rewards holders, and reduces supply — a true on-chain strategy loop.**
