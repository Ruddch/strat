## Summary

PENGU Strategy establishes a self-sustaining on-chain economy where:

- **Trading generates fees** ‚Äî Every PST transaction contributes 10% to the system
- **Treasury splits funds** ‚Äî 8% treasury allocation: 70% for PENGU trading operations, 30% for weekly dividends
- **PENGU traded with markup** ‚Äî Purchased PENGU formed into lots, sold at x1.1 markup when PENGU|ETH price allows
- **CEX price protection** ‚Äî All trades verified against centralized exchange prices to prevent manipulation
- **Profits burn PST** ‚Äî 100% of PENGU sale proceeds automatically buy back and burn PST tokens
- **Weekly dividend epochs** ‚Äî Holders receive PENGU dividends based on daily snapshots and holding duration

The longer you hold during each 7-day epoch, the greater your reward multiplier ‚Äî holding for the full week with all 7 snapshots provides 7x the rewards compared to only the final snapshot.

Every transaction strengthens the PENGU ecosystem, reduces PST supply through burns, and rewards long-term holders through the automated dividend system.
